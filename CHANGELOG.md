# Release notes

## v3.2.0 (2026-02-16)

- ✨ Added a file wather that wathes your file changes and refreshes Textwire AST nodes. It prevents you from restarting server everytime you want to see any changes in the browser.

## v3.1.2 (2026-02-15)

- 🧑‍💻 Full architecture change in directory and file structure. Doesn't break public API, just internal refactorking. Will be a breaking change if you use Textwire internals like parser, lexer, etc.

## v3.1.1 (2026-02-14)

- 🐛 Renamed 1 test file because it was causing some weird printing after `go get -u ./...` command.

## v3.1.0 (2026-02-14)

- 🧑‍💻 Added tests to make sure some age cases work.
- ✨ You can now add a fallback second argument to the reserve directive like this `@reserve('title', 'My Blog')` [#66](https://github.com/textwire/textwire/issues/66). It will be used when you didn't pass any inserts to that matching reseve.
- 🧑‍💻 Made slots defined in a component file optional.
- 🐛 Fixed bug where you could define multiple `@reserve` directives in a layout file. Now, you'll get an error.

## v3.0.2 (2026-02-11)

- ♻️ Lots of refactoring and improvements to the codebase, including adding tests for edge cases.
- 🐛 Fixed broken link on error page with debug mode on.

## v3.0.1 (2026-02-08)

- 🧑‍💻 Improve error messages.
- 🧑‍💻 Potentially a breaking change, but it should not be. You will receive a clear error if you trying to use `@insert` in a template file without defining `@use` directive. Previously, `@insert` would result in empty string in your template.
- 🐛 Fixed incorrect duplicate slot counter for error message when you have multiple duplicate slots in the same comonent.

## v3.0.0 (2026-02-07) — Major Release

### 🧑‍💻 Improvements

1. Improve error handling when trying to use `@use`, `@insert`, `@reserve` or `@component` directives in simple `EvaluateString` or `EvaluateFile` function calls. These directives are only allowed inside template files with `textwire.NewTemplate`.
2. Improve memory and performance. Read about improvements [here](https://textwire.github.io/blog/2026/02/05/textwire-v3#memory-performance).
3. Improve error messages. Now they are clearer.
4. Added tons of tests to make sure version 3 is stable.
5. You'll get a clear error when using 2 or more `@use` directives in the same template.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

1. Fixed incorrect file path in error messages when error happens inside `@insert` directive.
2. Fixed the `contains` function for strings; `{{ !"aaa".contains("a") }}` now returns the correct result.
3. Fixed the `contains` function for arrays; `{{ ![{}, 21].contains({age: 21}) }}` now returns the correct result.
4. Now you will get a proper error when trying to access a property on a non-object type like `{{ "str".nice }}`. Before, you would get a panic.
5. Fixed issue where you couldn't write a slot directive with space after the `@slot` keyword. This `@slot ("book")` was giving an error previously.
6. Now you will get an proper error when trying to use `@each` directive on non-array type.
7. Fixed bug where you couldn't use `@component` directive inside of a layout and `@component` inside of other components.

### ✨ New Features

1. Added `globals` object. You can now add `GlobalData` to your configurations and access this data in your templates using the `globals` object. For example: `globals.env`.
2. Added the `defined()` global function. It returns true if the variable is defined. [Docs](https://textwire.github.io/docs/v3/functions/global#defined)
3. Now you can add custom functions to objects as well with `RegisterObjFunc`.
4. Now you can use Go's embedded package to embed Textwire template files into a final binary.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

1. When you defined a custom function, now it returns type `any`. If you register any custom functions, make sure to change the return type to `any`.
2. Variable `global` is now reserved.
3. Fixed precedence for prefix expressions. Instead of `((!var).func())` we now have `(!(var.func()))`.
4. Changed default file extension from `.tw.html` to `.tw`. If you still want to support it, go to your configurations in `NewTemplate` or `Configure` and add field `TemplateExt: ".tw.html"` to it.
5. Minimal Go version support is version `1.25.0`.
6. Components in Textwire v2 would pass variables to their children automatially without manual passing. It was a bug. In Textwire v3 each component has its scope. You need to pass data manually `@component('user', { user })`.
7. Fixed variable leak from template to layout non-explicitly. In Textwire v2, if you had a variable in your template, it would be accessible in your layout without passing it explicitly. In Textwire v3, this is not available anymore.
