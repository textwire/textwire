Textwire is a simple yet powerful templating language for Go. It is designed to easily inject variables from Go code into a template file or just a regular string. It is inspired by Go's syntax and has a similar syntax to make it easier for Go developers to learn and use it.

## Contribute
### With Container Engine
> [!NOTE]
> If you use [üê≥ Docker](https://app.docker.com/) instead of [ü¶¶ Podman](https://podman.io/), just replace `podman-compose` with `docker compose` in code examples below.

#### Build an image
To build an image, navigate to the root of the project and run this command:
```bash
podman-compose build
```

#### Run the Container
To run a container, navigate to the root of the project and run this command:
```bash
podman-compose run --rm app
```

Optionally, if you want to be able to run `make run` in your container to check Textwire page in your browser (for manual testing purposes), then you need to run this:
```bash
podman-compose run --rm -p 8080:8080 app
```
