Textwire is a simple yet powerful templating language for Go. It is designed to easily inject variables from Go code into a template file or just a regular string. It is inspired by Go's syntax and has a similar syntax to make it easier for Go developers to learn and use it.

## Contribute
### Without Container Engine
You'll need to have Go installed on your machine.

### With Container Engine
If you use a container engine like [ü¶¶ Podman](https://podman.io/) or [üê≥ Docker](https://app.docker.com/), here are the steps that you can make:

#### Build an image
To build an image, navigate to the root of the project and run this command:
```bash
docker compose build
# for Podman, use:
podman-compose build
```

#### Run the container
To run a container, navigate to the root of the project and run this command:
```bash
docker compose run --rm app
# for Podman, use:
podman-compose run --rm app
```

Optionally, if you want to be able to run `make run` in your container to check Textwire page in your browser (for manual testing purposes), then you need to run this:
```bash
docker compose run --rm -p 8080:8080 app
# for Podman, use:
podman-compose run --rm -p 8080:8080 app
```
